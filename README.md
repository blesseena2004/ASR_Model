# Automatic Speech Recognition Model.
This repository contains an implementation of an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model, primarily leveraging the Wav2Vec2 models from Hugging Face's transformers library. The code focuses on loading and processing audio data, performing ASR inference, and generating transcriptions from audio files.
